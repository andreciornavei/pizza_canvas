A javascript library to build pizza with canvas

![](preview.gif)

## About
- This library helps you to build a pizza with an api interface;
- In the example was used an library from jqueryui to make a drag and drop experience;
- I have disposed an api to access some commands of library, like:
    - set tray asset background
    - set number of slices
    - set asset to slice
    - remove asset from slice
    - preview a slice on mouse position over
    - identify slice by mouse position
    - clear assets

## No dependences is needed to use the lib
Just open index.html on browser and see the magic happen.
